# e_collect_app

An eCollect App to help my university fundraise safely, quickly and from anywhere current and former students can contribute to the development of their Alma Mater.

## Motivation

I wanted to contribute in one way or another to the development of my university, and as I did not have enough financial means, I told myself to highlight my knowledge to support the idea that the college students had already started.

### Note

It is an unfinished project, but exposed to the university authorities and others of my city, to be able to be sponsored in the possibilities that they can, finally that it is effective and helps the university and even the life of the city to do a lot with tech.

#### !?

Don't forget, the App can be re-adapted to all fundraising needs, donations, charity galas, etc. Depending on requests.
